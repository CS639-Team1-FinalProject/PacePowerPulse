## Idea Proposal & Research

Students all around the world are currently dealing with several issues pertaining to their physical and mental well-being. These problems include managing academic pressures as well as stress, anxiety, sadness, and feelings of loneliness. Additionally, only roughly 50% of people fulfill the weekly need of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical exercise, which is part of the physical activity guidelines.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, accounting for around 3.2 million deaths annually. The CDC estimates that 8.3% of deaths in nondisabled adults 25 or older are attributed to inadequate levels of physical activity. For adults aged 40 to 69, 9.9% of deaths are attributed to inadequate physical activity, and for adults aged 70 or older, 7.8% are attributed to inadequate physical activity.Nearly 3.2 million deaths annually are due to physical inactivity.
