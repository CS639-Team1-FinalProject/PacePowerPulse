# FitnessApplication

## Idea Proposal & Research

Students all around the world are currently dealing with several issues pertaining to their physical and mental well-being. These problems include managing academic pressures as well as stress, anxiety, sadness, and feelings of loneliness. Additionally, only roughly 50% of people fulfill the weekly need of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical exercise, which is part of the physical activity guidelines.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, accounting for around 3.2 million deaths annually. The CDC estimates that 8.3% of deaths in nondisabled adults 25 or older are attributed to inadequate levels of physical activity. For adults aged 40 to 69, 9.9% of deaths are attributed to inadequate physical activity, and for adults aged 70 or older, 7.8% are attributed to inadequate physical activity.Nearly 3.2 million deaths annually are due to physical inactivity.

Majorly targeting audience of age group from mid 20's. As most of the people in mid 20's will have most energy when compared to other age groups and will have higher chances to adapt to any new routine and make it a habit.

Creating a "FitnessApplication" will help users achieve their health and fitness goals conveniently from their mobile devices. This app successfully tackles these problems and helps to enhance students' general well-being and well-being is the aim of our project.


This workout App will help Angel who is studying graduate program. She is good in her academics, but she’s not fit due to lack of focus on her physical health.
This application can help Angel to become fitter by showing different forms of exercises and she can track all the progress by History.

The Major features include.

Using SQLite, we can store data permanently on the device.
We use text to speech, which is very useful in so many different applications. 
We will use a media player, timers, recycle view for our project.


The FitnessApplication solution sets itself apart from competing products on the market with a number of special features. Its text-to-speech integration, which offers audio directions and feedback while exercising, is one of its distinctive characteristics. This feature improves inclusivity and accessibility by accommodating people who need or prefer aural instruction when working out. In addition, users can save user profiles, workout logs, and routines directly on their devices thanks to SQLite's data storage support, which guarantees data confidentiality and privacy. The software distinguishes itself further by focusing on a certain demographic, such as students in their mid-20s, and customizing its features and functionalities to suit their requirements and tastes. The FitnessApplication distinguishes itself from other solutions on the market by providing a range of features that give priority to user engagement, accessibility, and customization. Though there are many fitness apps accessible, not all of them might provide as much individualized user experience or text-to-speech integration as others. The FitnessApplication sets itself apart from other fitness apps by concentrating on providing focused solutions to solve the unique problems encountered by students, such as stress management in the classroom and placing a high priority on physical health.

￼
3. Nike Training Club: 

• This fitness app offers customers supervised training sessions conducted by qualified trainers. It provides a range of training schedules, exercise regimens, and workout programs catered to various fitness levels and objectives.

These current options demonstrate many strategies for tracking exercise and fitness, each with specific advantages and areas of emphasis. The FitnessApplication can find areas for feature improvement and differentiation to give consumers a distinctive and engaging fitness experience by examining these options.
